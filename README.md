# GliderSim

Simulation of equations presented in the paper, "Model-Based Feedback Control of Autonomous Underwater Gliders" by Naomi Ehrich Leonard and Joshua G. Graver (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/48.972106).

The program uses the SymPy, NumPy and Pandas libraries of Python for computation, substitution and storing the final results.

The program simulates the equations in the vertical (X-Z) plane for angle of attack and the position of movable mass as per the equations given on page: 639 and 640. The values of drag and lift coefficients are taken as it is from the paper along with the values of mass and mass coefficients.

The inputs for the program include Glide Angle (zeta_d) and the Lift and Drag Coefficient (K_L, K_D0, K_D)
